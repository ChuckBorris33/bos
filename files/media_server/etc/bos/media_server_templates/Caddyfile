# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
#
# This file configures Caddy to reverse proxy to your local services
# using the short names defined in your dnsmasq hosts file.
#
# Caddy will automatically generate and serve self-signed SSL certificates
# for these names. Your browser will show a one-time warning that you
# will need to accept.

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# Replace "100.X.Y.Z" with your server's Tailscale IP address (`tailscale ip -4`)
# to ensure Caddy only listens on the Tailscale network.
